## Prerequisites

The course is intended for those who have basic familiarity with Unix and the R scripting language.

We will also assume that you are familiar with mapping and analysing bulk RNA-seq data as well as with the commonly available computational tools.

* If a refresher is needed for Unix command line (hopefully not), please go over [this tutorial](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/) and its [companion cheatsheet](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/cheatsheet.php).
* Getting down to basics: an introduction to the fundamentals of R ([courtesy of Mark Ravinet](markravinet.github.io/Introduction.html)).
* Gentle introduction to `R/Biocondutor`: [here](https://bioconductor.github.io/BiocWorkshops/introduction-to-bioconductor-annotation-resources.html)
* For a full in-depth guide of `Bioconductor` ecosystem: read the comprehensive `R/Bioconductor` book from Kasper D. Hansen available under the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license [[PDF]](/{{<myPackageUrl>}}docs/bioconductor.pdf)

## Local configuration 

* Ideally (though not strictly required), a configured SSH client (it should be already installed on Linux/Mac machines, `puTty` can be set up for Windows). 
* Ideally (though not strictly required), a SSH ftp client (`Forklift` is excellent for Mac, although not free; `cyberduck` can be used for Windows; FileZilla can be used for both Mac and Linux).
* Computer with high-speed internet access (no specific configuration required - everything will be performed on a remote AWS machine). 
* Zoom visioconference software
