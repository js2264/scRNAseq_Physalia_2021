## Prerequisites

The course is intended for those who have basic familiarity with Unix and the R scripting language.

We will also assume that you are familiar with mapping and analysing bulk RNA-seq data as well as with the commonly available computational tools.

* If a refresher is needed for Unix command line (hopefully not), please go over [this tutorial](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/) and its [companion cheatsheet](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/cheatsheet.php).
* For a refresher in `R/Bioconductor`: please read the comprehensive `R/Bioconductor` book from Kasper D. Hansen available under the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license [[PDF]](/{{<myPackageUrl>}}docs/bioconductor.pdf)

## Local configuration 

* Configured SSH client for Windows (it should be already installed on Linux/Mac machines)
